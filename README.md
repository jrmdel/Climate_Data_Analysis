# Climate Data Analysis

The aim of this study is to explore some analysis tools provided by R. We found that dataset on kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data) and felt that we could extract interesting information from it, but we have no precise direction to follow. We hope to find something peculiar that makes us investigate a bit more.

## Prerequisites

So far, we intend to work with the language R so we'll need :

- R
- RStudio as an IDE

Plus some useful packages such as :

- FactoMineR
